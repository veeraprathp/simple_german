```

### Infrastructure Components
- **VPC:** Isolated network with public/private subnets
- **RDS:** PostgreSQL 14+ with Multi-AZ deployment
- **S3:** Buckets for artifacts, logs, and model storage
- **Redis:** ElastiCache cluster for caching
- **EC2:** GPU instances for model serving (T4/A10)
- **ALB:** Application Load Balancer for API gateway

### Development Tools
- **Python 3.11+** with virtual environment
- **Docker & Docker Compose** for containerization
- **Terraform** for infrastructure as code
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD
- **VS Code** with Python, Docker, and Terraform extensions

---

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Repository Setup (Day 1)
1. Create GitHub repository with proper structure
2. Initialize git with main branch protection
3. Set up branch naming conventions (feature/, bugfix/, hotfix/)
4. Create initial README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md
5. Set up issue and PR templates

### Step 2: Local Development Environment (Day 1-2)
1. Create Python virtual environment
2. Set up requirements.txt with core dependencies
3. Create docker-compose.yml for local development
4. Configure VS Code settings and extensions
5. Set up pre-commit hooks for code quality

### Step 3: Infrastructure Provisioning (Day 2-3)
1. Create Terraform configuration files
2. Set up AWS/GCP provider configuration
3. Define VPC, subnets, and security groups
4. Configure RDS PostgreSQL instance
5. Set up S3 buckets with proper permissions
6. Configure Redis ElastiCache cluster

### Step 4: CI/CD Pipeline (Day 3-4)
1. Create GitHub Actions workflow files
2. Set up automated testing pipeline
3. Configure Docker image building and pushing
4. Set up deployment to staging environment
5. Create environment-specific configurations

### Step 5: Model Evaluation (Day 4-5)
1. Set up Hugging Face account and API access
2. Test model locally with sample German texts
3. Benchmark performance metrics (latency, quality)
4. Create model evaluation scripts
5. Document model capabilities and setup process

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Cloud Provider Limits:** Start with free tier, monitor usage
- **Model Size:** Use quantized models, implement streaming
- **Infrastructure Costs:** Set up billing alerts, use spot instances
- **Dependency Issues:** Pin versions, use virtual environments

### Process Risks
- **Setup Complexity:** Create detailed documentation, provide scripts
- **Team Onboarding:** Create setup guides, record setup process
- **Environment Drift:** Use infrastructure as code, regular updates

## Next Steps After Completion

1. **Ticket 002:** Implement core FastAPI backend
2. **Ticket 003:** Add Redis caching and chunking logic
3. **Ticket 004:** Create browser extension
4. **Ticket 005:** Build React dashboard

## Notes

- Ensure all cloud resources are properly tagged for cost tracking
- Set up billing alerts to prevent unexpected costs
- Document all environment variables and secrets
- Create backup and disaster recovery procedures
- Establish security best practices from the start
